FEATURES
- entity loader
- dampness ~ rain, water level (TODO), swimming -> flu, disease ~ temperature as well
- fatigue value, e.g. Old Man Willow, disease, FEAR that causes auto-flee?
- introduce dawn/dusk times ~ season => would bugger TimeCycle, map-lighter entity manager ~ dawn/dusk, mock lantern for NPCs?
- create character: name, race, gender, alignment, attributes ~ character class archetype & race, equipment/skills ~ race, factions ~ starting location ~ race, cash? => builder, save controller
- location triggers: quest triggers, watch locations?
- quests, deeds: collect N objects, visit locations, kill X of race category
- move group/followers -> MoveAction (probably not a move-controller listener)
- persistant player modifications: new skills, carried objects, XP earned, etc => some sort of re-playable log?
- regeneration ~ furniture (bed, chair, etc)
- sneaking: feel exposed in open terrain, X comes dangerously close to your hiding place
[DONE?] - objects that cast visions: palantir, Galadriels mirror, Mirrormere, Seat of Amon Hen => objects -> description, Amon Hen -> views?
- how to model fear effect of Nazgul? sort of aura?
- combat controller
- PlayerName command-arg: post letter <name>, tell <name> xxx, etc

TODO
- is sneak a movement mode? higher STA cost, less noise, less tracks visibility
- weather will be different in neighbouring areas! => global weather?
- PC::alert -> response handler? how? listener accepts response
- ferry ticket seller / ferryman => not all waypoints need tickets (e.g. orphans)
- other AI responses, default 'emote'
- calendar::isLeapYear imcompatible with DateTime from Clock!
- currents: damage if rapids/waterfall, fall off boat
- location contents for paths and grids
- archetype loader: furniture, vehicle, others
- draw action sheathes current weapon (and potentially swaps)
- action BROADCAST flag and implementation
- object stack limit -> descriptor
- partial exit descriptions, e.g. fog
- auto carry
- reveal handler -> player hidden, control XML inside the controlled object/link?
- fire-place light? fixture, can be re-fueled with wood, put wood campfire | fireplace, or light campfire | fireplace
- invoke EntityController::update AI in DefaultNotificationHandler

TESTING
- all other actions
- coverage report (especially actions)
- effect controller test

IMPROVEMENTS
- Equipment: only needed for PC, equivalent for NPCs (e.g. emissions). Overlaps with Inventory? Either combine or break dependency on inv.
- WorldLoader is a mess!
- Loader interface (for POJOs that can self-load)?
- gates/shops refer to *single* faction in current loader context, better to lookup by name (implies need faction name in XML) and/or use default?
- grid neighbours currently limited to current area
- Money size <- amount, banded, e.g. < 10s small, <100s medium, etc
- underground views?
- multiple ambient events - either multiple ambient descriptors, or single descriptor with multiple names?
- cache should insert into priority-queue, no point in sorting on every eviction => entry is comparable
- consider splitting up large packages?
